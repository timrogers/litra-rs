## Supported devices

The following Logitech Litra devices, __connected via USB__, are supported:

* [Logitech Litra Glow](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/lighting/litra-glow.946-000002.html)
* [Logitech Litra Beam](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/lighting/litra-beam.946-000007.html)

## Installation

### macOS or Linux via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

1. Install the latest version by running `brew tap timrogers/tap && brew install litra`.
1. Run `litra --help` to check that everything is working and see the available commands.

### macOS, Linux or Windows via [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), Rust's package manager

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your machine, if it isn't already installed.
1. Install the `litra` crate by running `cargo install litra`.
1. Run `litra --help` to check that everything is working and see the available commands.

### macOS, Linux or Windows via direct binary download

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/timrogers/litra-rs/releases/latest) for your platform. macOS, Linux and Windows devices are supported.
2. Add the binary to `$PATH`, so you can execute it from your shell. For the best experience, call it `litra` on macOS and Linux, and `litra.exe` on Windows.
3. Run `litra --help` to check that everything is working and see the available commands.

### Configuring `udev` permissions on Linux

On most Linux operating systems, you will need to manually configure permissions using [`udev`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/udev.7.html) to allow non-`root` users to access and manage Litra devices.

To allow all users that are part of the `video` group to access the Litra devices, copy the [`99-litra.rules`](99-litra.rules) file into `/etc/udev/rules.d`.
Next, reboot your computer or run the following commands as `root`:

    # udevadm control --reload-rules
    # udevadm trigger

## Usage

### From the command line

The following commands are available for controlling your devices:

- `litra on`: Turn your Logitech Litra device on
- `litra off`: Turn your Logitech Litra device off
- `litra toggle`: Toggles your Logitech Litra device on or off
- `litra brightness`: Sets the brightness of your Logitech Litra device, using either `--value` (measured in lumens) or `--percentage` (as a percentage of the device's maximum brightness). The brightness can be set to any value between the minimum and maximum for the device returned by the `devices` command.
- `litra brightness-up`: Increases the brightness of your Logitech Litra device, using either `--value` (measured in lumens) or `--percentage` (with a number of percentage points to add to the device's brightness)
- `litra brightness-down`: Decreases the brightness of your Logitech Litra device, using either `--value` (measured in lumens) or `--percentage` (with a number of percentage points to subtract from the device's brightness)
- `litra temperature`: Sets the temperature of your Logitech Litra device, using a `--value` measured in kelvin (K). The temperature can be set to any multiple of 100 between the minimum and maximum for the device returned by the `devices` command.
- `litra temperature-up`: Increases the temperature of your Logitech Litra device, using a `--value` measured in kelvin (K). The value must be a multiple of 100.
- `litra temperature-down`: Decreases the temperature of your Logitech Litra device, using a `--value` measured in kelvin (K). The value must be a multiple of 100.

All of the these commands support a `--serial-number`/`-s` argument to specify the serial number of the device you want to target. If you only have one Litra device, you can omit this argument. If you have multiple devices, we recommend specifying it. If it isn't specified, the "first" device will be picked, but this isn't guaranteed to be stable between command runs.

The following commands are also included:

- `litra devices`: List Logitech Litra devices connected to your computer. This will be returned in human-readable format by default, or you can get JSON output with the `--json` flag.

Each CLI command can also be called with `--help` for more detailed documentation.

### From a Model Context Protocol (MCP) client

Running the `litra mcp` command starts a local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, exposing tools to allow you to control your Litra devices from AI applications and agents.

#### Usage with Claude Desktop

To use the MCP server with Claude Desktop:

1. From the Claude app, open the "Developer" menu, then click "Open App Config File...".
1. Add the MCP server to the `mcpServers` key in your config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "litra": {
      "command": "litra",
      "args": [
        "mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

1. Back in the Claude app, open the "Developer" menu, then click "Reload MCP Configuration".
1. To check that the MCP server is running, start a chat, then click the "Search and tools" button under the chat input, and check for a "litra" item in the menu.

#### Available Tools

The following tools are available:

- `litra_devices`: List available Logitech Litra devices
- `litra_on`: Turn your Logitech Litra device on
- `litra_off`: Turn your Logitech Litra device off
- `litra_toggle`: Toggles your Logitech Litra device on or off
- `litra_brightness`: Sets the brightness of your Logitech Litra device to either a specific value measured in lumens (lm) or a percentage of the device's maximum brightness. The brightness can be set to any value between the minimum and maximum for the device returned by the `litra_devices` tool.
- `litra_brightness_up`: Increases the brightness of your Logitech Litra device, using either a specific value (measured in lumens) or a percentage of the device's maximum brightness
- `litra_brightness_down`: Decreases the brightness of your Logitech Litra device, using either a specific value (measured in lumens) or a percentage of the device's maximum brightness
- `litra_temperature`: Sets the temperature of your Logitech Litra device to a specific value measured in kelvin (K). The temperature can be set to any multiple of 100 between the minimum and maximum for the device returned by the `litra_devices` tool.
- `litra_temperature_up`: Increases the temperature of your Logitech Litra device, using a specific value measured in kelvin (K). The value must be a multiple of 100.
- `litra_temperature_down`: Decreases the temperature of your Logitech Litra device, using a specific measured in kelvin (K). The value must be a multiple of 100.

### From a Rust application

The `litra` crate includes functions for interacting with Litra devices from your Rust applications.

To see the full API, check out the documentation on [Docs.rs](https://docs.rs/litra/) or read through [`src/lib.rs`](src/lib.rs).
